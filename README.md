# text-bot

This text bot application is built using Flask and Twilio, and is running in an AWS lambda function.

Images and quotes are returned using the Pexels and Quotable APIs.

To interact with the bot, text any word you would like to see an image of to [206.495.6559](tel:2064956559).

If an image is found that matches your word, you'll receive a text back of the image, along with a famous quote!
